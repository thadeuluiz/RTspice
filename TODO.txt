1 - setup linear system solver
  * vectors for JA, IA and A
  * vector  for b

2 - setup component-node registration
  * register node names and assign an address for each used position in
      A and b
  * dummy unused variable for ground node references in A, b.
  * constant dummy variable for ground node in x(n) and x'(n+1)

3 - setup behavioural filling of the linear system:
  * pass x(n), x'(n+1) and timestep for components: each component handles
      its appropriate stamping
      a. first, linear static components: sources and resistors
      b. nonlinear static components
      c. dynamic linear components
      d. dynamic nonlinear components

4 - graphing gui? which variables to save?
